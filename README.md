## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No other libraries are needed to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using NTSB accident data to better understand:

1. When is the most dangerous time during each flight phases?
2. Is airplane more safe or less safe during the last few decades?
3. Which airplane model has the highest fatal accident?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a Python Jupyter Notebook available [here](./Aviation.ipynb) to answer the above questions. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@qiuxinjie/3-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-of-air-travel-safety-43cddf33cd23).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit goest to NTSB and Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the NTSB [here](https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx) and Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
